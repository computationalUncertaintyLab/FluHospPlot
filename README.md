# Epidemic curves of hospitlziations due to confirmed influenza at the state and US national level
We update on a weekly basis plots of hospitlziations due to influenza as a tool to support human judgment forecasting on the [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/) platform. Field 34---number of confirmed influenza admissions---is collected from [COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u). 


## To do 
1. Write a git-action to run this Makefile every day. 
2. Find an algprithm that places textual descriptions of the number of reported infleunza cases so that they do not overlap the graph.
