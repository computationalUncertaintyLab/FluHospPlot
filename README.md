# The number of incident hospitalizations due to confirmed influenza at the state and US national level
We update, weekly, plots of incident hospitalizations due to influenza as a tool to support human judgment forecasting on the [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/) platform.
Field 34---number of confirmed influenza admissions---is collected from [COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u). 

## Structure
Every week a folder is generated with the date that all state and national plots were created. 
Inside this folder there exists two plots for each state: a png and a html. 
The png file can be viewed from a browser and is static. The html can be downloaded to your local computer and is interactive.
